### `StateView`: fix `"refId" not found` from out-of-order `view.changes`

`Encoder.encodeView` iterated `view.changes` in Map insertion order, which
isn't always topological. Sequences that mixed `view.remove` with a later
`view.add` — including `view.add` after re-parenting an instance via a
collection push — could leave a child's entry in the Map ahead of an
ancestor that hadn't been touched yet. The wire stream then emitted
`SWITCH_TO_STRUCTURE` for the child before any earlier op had registered
its refId on the decoder, surfacing as `"refId" not found` (and the
remainder of that patch silently skipped).

`Encoder.encodeView` now iterates in topological order via a DFS
post-order over the parent chain. The pass is gated on a
`StateView.changesOutOfOrder` flag set inside `StateView.remove` (the
only operation that bypasses `addParentOf`'s deepest-ancestor-first
ordering) and reset when `view.changes` is cleared, so the hot path
stays at plain Map iteration when no `remove` happened in the tick.

Same wire-order class as colyseus/colyseus#936; the fix here closes it
at the schema layer so any consumer of `Encoder.encodeView` gets a
topologically ordered stream by construction.

Thanks to @anaibol for the test cases ported from colyseus/colyseus#936
and to @Gabixel for the standalone reproducer at
[Gabixel/colyseus-test-stateview-repo](https://github.com/Gabixel/colyseus-test-stateview-repo).

### `@view`: nested Schema fields inherit parent visibility

Previously, when a `@view`-gated field held a nested `Schema`, the nested
instance was encoded but its fields were not — clients would see the reference
but every property came through as `undefined`. The only workaround was to wrap
the nested instance in an `ArraySchema`, which propagated visibility from the
parent.

Nested `Schema` fields now inherit visibility from a `@view`-gated parent
regardless of whether the parent is a collection. Nested fields decorated with
their own `@view` continue to opt out, so explicit per-field gating is
preserved.

Thanks to @FTWinston for the contribution (#218).

## 4.0.20

### C# codegen: emit native `enum` for positive-int enums

The Unity/C# code generator now emits a native `public enum Name : int { ... }`
when every member of a TypeScript enum resolves to a non-negative integer
(implicit index-based or explicit positive int values). String and float enums
continue to emit `public struct` with `public const` fields, since C# native
enums only support integral underlying types.

Benefits: improved type-safety and proper dropdown display for serialized
enum fields in the Unity Inspector.

**Potential source-level break:** native C# enum values are strongly typed,
so comparisons against raw ints now require a cast — e.g.
`if ((int)myEnum == 0)` or, preferably, `if (myEnum == MyEnum.Foo)`.
Wire format is unchanged.
